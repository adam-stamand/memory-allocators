## Overview
This project is intended to be an example of both an implementation of several memory allocators as well as a demonstration of several code management tools. This project (as well as this README) are a work in progress. As of this writing version 0.1.0 has been released with minimal testing, but more work is required to verify the existing code and to implement more interesting allocators.

### Memory Allocation
* Linear Allocator
* Stack Allocator
* Free List Allocator
* More to come... 


### Code Management Tools
* Continuous Integration (TravisCI)
* Coverity Check (Synopsys)
* Documentation (Sphinx)
* Code Coverage (Coveralls)
